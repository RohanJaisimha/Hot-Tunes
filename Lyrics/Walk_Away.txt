Ooh, ooh
I guess I shoulda known better
To believe that my luck had changed (Luck had changed), ooh
I let my heart and forever
Finally learn each other's names (Each other's names)
I tell myself, "This time, it's different"
No goodbyes 'cause I can't bear to say 'em
I'll never survive the one that's comin'
If I stay (If I stay), oh, no
Just walk away, oh, and don't look back
'Cause if my heart breaks, it's gonna hurt so bad
You know I'm strong, but I can't take that
Before it's too late
Oh, just walk away
Walk, walk, walk away
Ooh, just walk away
Walk, walk, walk away
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
I really wish I could blame you
But I know that it's no one's fault (No one's fault)
(No, no, no, no, ooh)
A Cinderella with no shoe
And a prince that doesn't know he's lost (Know he's lost)
This emptiness feels so familiar (Familiar)
Each goodbye, just the same old song
But this time, I will not surrender
'Cause I'm gone ('Cause I'm gone), oh, yeah
Just walk away, oh, and don't look back
'Cause if my heart breaks, it's gonna hurt so bad
You know I'm strong, but I can't take that
Before it's too late
Oh, just walk away
Walk, walk, walk away
Oh, just walk away
Walk, walk, walk away
Oh, just walk away
I've got to let it go, oh
Start protectin' my heart and soul
'Cause I don't think I'll survive a goodbye again
Not again
Just walk away, oh, and don't look back
'Cause if my heart breaks, it's gonna hurt so bad
You know I'm strong, but I can't take that
Before it's too late (Before it's too late)
Oh, just walk away
Walk, walk, walk away
Walk away, walk away, yeah
Walk, walk, walk away
Walk away, walk away, oh no
Walk, walk, walk away
Walk away, walk away
Walk, walk, walk away
Walk away, walk away, oh
