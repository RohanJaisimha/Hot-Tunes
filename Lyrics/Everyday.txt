Once in a lifetime
Means there's no second chance
So I believe that you and me
Should grab it while we can
Make it last forever
And never give it back
It's our turn and I'm lovin' where we're at
Because this moment's really all we have
Everyday of our lives
Wanna find you there, wanna hold on tight
Gonna run
While we're young
And keep the faith
Everyday
From right now
Gonna use our voices and scream out loud
Take my hand
Together we will celebrate
Celebrate
Oh, everyday
They say that you should follow
And chase down what you dream
But if you get lost and lose yourself
What does it really mean?
Oh
No matter where we're goin'
Ooh yeah
It starts from where we are
There's more to life when we listen to our hearts
And because of you, I've got the strength to start
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Everyday of our lives
Wanna find you there
Wanna hold on tight
Gonna run while we're young
And keep the faith
Oh, everyday
From right now
Gonna use our voices and scream out loud
Take my hand
Together we will celebrate
Oh, everyday
We're takin' it back
We're doin' it here together
It's better like that
And stronger now than ever
We're not gonna lose
'Cause we get to choose
That's how it's gonna be
Everyday of our lives
Wanna find you there, wanna hold on tight
Gonna run while we're young
And keep the faith
Keep the faith
Everyday of our lives
Wanna find you there
Wanna hold on tight
Gonna run (Gonna run)
While we're young
And keep the faith (Oh, yeah, yeah)
Everyday (Everyday)
From right now (Right now)
Gonna use our voices and scream out loud
Take my hand (Take my hand)
Together we will celebrate
