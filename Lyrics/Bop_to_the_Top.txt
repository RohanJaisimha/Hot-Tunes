Mucho gusto
¡Ay, qué fabulosa!
¡Rrrrr, ay, ay, ay!
¡Arriba!
¿Quieres bailar?
Mírame
I believe in dreamin'
Shooting for the stars
Baby, to be number one
You've got to raise the bar
Kickin' and a-scratchin'
Grinding out my best
Anything it takes to climb
The ladder of success
Work our tails off every day
Gotta bump the competition, blow them all away
¡Caliente!
¡Suave!
(sung)
Yeah, we're gonna...
Bop, bop, bop
Bop to the top
Slip and slide and ride that rhythm
Jump and hop
Hop 'til we drop
And start again
Zip, zap, zop
Pop like a mop
Scoot around the corner
Move it to the groove 'til the music stops
Do the bop, bop, bop to the top
Don't ever stop
Bop to the top
Gimme, gimme
Shimmy, shimmy
Shake some booty and turn around
Flash a smile in their direction
Show some muscle
Do the hustle
Yeah, we're gonna...
Bop, bop, bop
Bop to the top
Wipe away your inhibitions
Stump, stump, stump
Do the rump
And strut your stuff
Bop, bop, bop
Straight to the top
Goin' for the glory
We'll keep steppin' up
And we just won't stop...
Stop...
'Til we reach the top
Bop to the top
