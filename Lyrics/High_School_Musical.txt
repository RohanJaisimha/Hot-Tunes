Here we go! (Woo!)
C'mon!
Alright
Little louder, now
Hey!
(Woo!)
Lookin' forward from center stage to graduation day
Time to get the future started
What we leave, what we take with us, no matter what
It's something we're part of
We learned to fly
Together, side by side (Side by side)
I just hope the rest of my life
Will feel as good as my...
High school musical
Who says we have to let it go?
It's the best part we've ever known
Step into the future
But hold on to high school musical
Let's celebrate where we come from
The friends who've been there all along, just like
A high school, high school musical
Improvisation without a script
No one's written it
And now we have the chance to
But someday, we'll be lookin' back, memories we'll have
All the songs that we lived through
The best of times
So why leave them behind? (Behind)
Why can't the rest of my life
Be like my...
High school musical (Yeah)
Who says we have to let it go?
It's the best part we've ever known (Yeah)
Step into the future
But hold on to high school musical (Woo!)
Let's celebrate where we come from (Hey)
The friends who've been there all along
That's right (That's right)
Now we finally realize
Who we are, it just took some time
We had to live and to learn to see the truth
(Learn to see the truth)
That nothing's ever impossible
Into the future, we all free-fall (Free-fall)
But forever, we'll always have high school
High...
Time to party, now, celebrate
School...
'Cause the world's one big stage
Musical
And any part you want can be yours
Everybody sing, yeah
High...
Yeah, the show is never gonna close
School...
It's what got us here, we know
Musical
High school lives on forevermore
High school, high school musical
