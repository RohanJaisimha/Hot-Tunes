How did we get from the top of the world
To the bottom of the heap?
I don't recall you mentioning
The boss is such a creep!
We still have the ingredients
To make this summer sweet
Well, I got rags instead of riches
And all these dirty dishes
Just wish I had three wishes
Okay, guys, break it up
We've got to work, work, to work this out
We'll make things right, the sun will shine
If we work, work, there'll be no doubt
We can still save the summer
If we work this out
Dude, what have you gotten us into?
Come on, we can totally turn this thing around!
I'd rather face a seven-footer
Straight up in the post (Yeah)
That sure beats hangin' here
And burnin' someone's toast (Uh-huh)
I needed Benjamins
But this ain't worth the stress
Maybe there's a better way
To fix this greasy mess
We're a champion team, a well-oiled machine
And we've faced tougher problems than this
I know it's a grind, but I'm sure we can find
A way to have fun while we get this job done
We've got to work, work, to work this out
We'll make things right, the sun will shine
Got to work, work, there'll be no doubt
If we all come together, we can work this out
Let's work it!
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
A little bit of sugar
A little bit of butter
It's the perfect recipe
Pay day!
It'll taste so sweet
Pay day!
Good enough to eat
Gonna make some motion pictures
Hit the mall with all my sisters
Get tickets to the Knicks and Sixers
Kick it with the music mixers
Buy a ride that suits my style
Lounge around the pool awhile
Make a date with my favorite girl
We've got it made!
Whoa, we've got to work, work, to work this out
We'll make things right, the sun will shine
If we work, work, there'll be no doubt
We can still save the summer
If we work this out
Work this
Gotta work this
We can work this out
