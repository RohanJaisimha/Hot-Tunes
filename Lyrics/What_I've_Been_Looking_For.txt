It's hard to believe that I couldn't see
You were always there beside me
Thought I was alone, with no one to hold
But you were always right beside me
This feeling's like no other
I want you to know
I've never had someone
That knows me like you do
The way you do
I've never had someone
As good for me as you
No one like you
So lonely before
I finally found
What I've been looking for
So good to be seen
So good to be heard
Don't have to say a word
For so long I was lost
So good to be found
I'm lovin' havin' you around
This feeling's like no other
I want you to know
I've never had someone
That knows me like you do
The way you do
I've never had someone
As good for me as you
No one like you
So lonely before
I finally found
What I've been looking for
Do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
