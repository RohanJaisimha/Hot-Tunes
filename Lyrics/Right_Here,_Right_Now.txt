Mmm, yeah, hey, yeah
Can you imagine what would happen
If we could have any dream?
I'd wish this moment was ours to own it
And that it would never leave
Then I would thank that star
That made our wish come true (Come true), oh, yeah (Hmm-hmm)
'Cause he knows that where you are
Is where I should be too
Right here, right now (Yeah)
I'm lookin' at you and my heart loves the view
'Cause you mean everything (Ooh)
Right here, I promise you, somehow
That tomorrow can wait (Oh-oh)
For some other day to be (To be)
But right now, there's you and me
Hmm
If this was forever, what could be better?
We've already proved it works
But in two thousand one hundred twenty-three hours (Oh)
A bend in the universe
Is gonna make everything (Everything)
In our whole world change (It's all changin')
And you know that where we are (Where we are)
Will never be the same
Oh, no
Oh, no
Right here, right now
Right now
I'm lookin' at you and my heart loves the view
'Cause you mean everything (Everything)
Right here (Right here)
I promise you, somehow (Somehow we're gonna)
Tomorrow can wait
For some other day to be (To be)
But right now, there's you and me
Oh, we know it's comin' (Comin')
And it's comin' fast (It's always you and me)
Oh, yeah
So let's make this second last
Make it last
Right here
Oh, right now
Yeah, I'm lookin' at you
And my heart loves the view
'Cause you mean everything
Right here, I promise you, somehow
That tomorrow can wait
For some other day to be (To be)
But right now there's you and me
You and me (You and me)
Oh, you and me
But right now there's you and me
