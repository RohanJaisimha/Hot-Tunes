A long time ago, in a land far away
Lived the Pineapple Princess Tiki
She was sweet as a peach in a pineapple way
But so sad that she hardly speaky
Still, if you listen well, you'll hear her secret wish
Aloha, everybody. My name is Tiki!
(sung)
I long to free a truly remarkable fish
My sweet prince
Humuhumunukunukuapua'a
Makihiki malahini who
Humuhumunukunukuapua'a, ooh
Hawana waka, waka, waka, niki pu, pu, pu
(spoken)
Ryan, the fog?
She dreams of a boy who is under a spell
That has left him all wet and scaly
I sing from my heart of the power of love
Just a girl with a ukulele
Come to me (Come to her)
My sweet one and be still
I'll grasp your tail then stroke each tender gill
My sweet prince
Humuhumunukunukuapua'a
Makihiki malahini who
Humuhumunukunukuapua'a, ooh
Hawana waka, waka, waka, niki pu, pu, pu
(spoken)
Now, this is where we lean into the whole Kabuki thing!
(sung)
The clouds turned gray
And the big sky cried
And the ocean had a fit
(spoken)
Ryan, where's my ocean?
(sung)
Then the wind went whoosh
And thunder cracked
And mighty Mount Fufu spit
(spoken)
Mighty Mount Fufu spit!
T-T-T-Tiki, T-Tiki
Wanna speaky, speaky, speaky
With the mighty spirit Fufu
T-T-T-Tiki, T-Tiki
Wanna speaky, speaky, speaky
The words (Word!) I will not mince
Please make a man of my fresh fish prince
(spoken)
This is real fish talk, no lie
(GURGLING FISH NOISES)
(spoken)
And then the fish turns into a gorgeous prince and sings...
(sung)
I'm Prince Humuhumunukunukuapua'a
Makihiki malahini who
(spoken)
With me!
(sung)
Humuhumunukunukuapua'a, ooh
Hawana waka, waka, waka, niki pu, pu, pu
(spoken)
Everybody!
Humuhumunukunukuapua'a
Makihiki malahini who
Humuhumunukunukuapua'a, ooh
Hawana waka, waka, waka, niki pu, pu, pu
Waka, waka, waka, niki pu, pu, pu
Waka, waka, waka, niki pu, pu, pu
