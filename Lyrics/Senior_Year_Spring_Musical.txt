It's our last chance to share the stage
Before we go our separate ways
High school wasn't meant to last forever
It's our last chance for us to shine
To bring you music one more time
So come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
W-I-L-D, Wildcats
You know you're on
W-I-L-D, Wildcats
Come on, come on
East High boys, hey
Let's make some noise, oh, yeah
W-I-L-D (Yeah), Wildcats
Now's the time
(Wildcats!)
This is the last time to get it right (Go, Wildcats!)
This is the last chance to make it our night (Hey, Wildcats)
We gotta show what we're all about (Team!) (Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!)
Work together (Wildcats!)
This is the last chance to make our mark (Go, Wildcats!)
History will know who we are (Hey, Wildcats)
This is the last game, so make it count (Go, go, go, go!)
It's now or never, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
Oh...
I want it all!
I want it, want it, want it
The fame and the fortune and more
I want it all
I want it, want it, want it
I gotta have my star on the door
I want the world, nothin' less
All the glam and the press
Only givin' me the best reviews
I want it all, want it all, want it all, want it all, want it all
Kick it, girls
(sung)
I want it all, want it all, want it all, want it all, want it all!
We (We want it!) want it...
(We want it!) All
My band! Thank you!
East High, you're amazing!
Good night
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
I got a lotta things I have to do
All these distractions, our future's comin' soon
We're being pulled a hundred different directions
But whatever happens, I know I've got you
You're on my mind, you're in my heart
It doesn't matter where we are
We'll be alright, even if we're miles apart
...Even if we're miles apart
...Even if we're miles and miles and miles apart!
All I wanna do
Is be with you, be with you
There's nothing we can't do (Ew)
Just wanna be with you
Only you
And no matter where life takes us
Nothing can break us apart
I just wanna be with...
Ew!
You
You know how life can be
It changes overnight
It's sunny then rainin'
But it's alright
A friend like you
Always makes it easy
I know that you get me
Every time
Through every up, through every down
You know I'll always be around
Through anything, you can count on me
All I wanna do
Is be with you, be with you
There's nothing we can't do
Just wanna be with you, only you
No matter where life takes us
Nothing can break us apart (You know it's true)
I just wanna be with you, you
I just wanna be with you
The sun will always shine
That's how you make me feel
We're gonna be alright
'Cause what we have is real
And we will always be together
All I wanna do
Is be with you, be with you
There's nothing we can't do
Just wanna be with you, only you
No matter where life takes us
Nothing can break us apart (You know it's true)
I just wanna be with you
All I wanna do
All that I wanna do is be with you
All that I wanna do is be with you (Oh, only you, all I wanna do)
All that I wanna do is be with you (Yeah, yeah, I just wanna be with you)
All that I wanna do
I just wanna be with you
Who's that girl?
(sung)
She's so fine
(spoken)
Who's that girl?
(sung)
I don't recognize
(spoken)
Who's that girl?
(sung)
She looks so good, yeah
Guess we never really noticed, but we probably should
Big fun! On the night of nights
The night of nights, tonight
Let's dance! On the night of nights
You know we're gonna do it right
It's gonna be our night
You know it!
To remember
For all time!
Surprise!
Big fun!
It's gonna be the night
We love it!
To last forever
The rest of our lives!
We'll never, ever, ever forget
It's gonna be my night!
Oh, yeah!
All together
Say it loud!
Come on, now
Everyone, that's right!
It's gonna be a night
You can bet!
To remember
Hear the crowd!
And never, ever, ever, never
Ever, ever, never, ever
Never, ever, ever forget!
