Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, yeah
You are the music in me
You know the words "Once upon a time"
Make you listen, there's a reason
When you dream, there's a chance you'll find
A little laughter
Or happy ever after
You're harmony to the melody
That's echoin' inside my head
A single voice (Single voice)
Above the noise
And like a common thread
Hmm, you're pullin' me
When I hear my favorite song
I know that we belong
Oh, you are the music in me
Yeah, it's livin' in all of us
And it's brought us here because
Because you are the music in me
Na-na-na-na
Oh
Na-na-na-na
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Na-na-na-na
You are the music in me
It's like I knew you before we met (Before we met)
Can't explain (Oh, oh)
There's no name for it (No name for it)
I sang you words I never said
And it was easy (So easy)
Because you see the real me (I see)
As I am, you understand
And that's more than I've ever known
To hear your voice (Hear your voice)
Above the noise (Oh, oh)
And know I'm not alone
Oh, you're singin' to me (Ooh, yeah)
When I hear my favorite song
I know that we belong, yeah, oh
You are the music in me
It's livin' in all of us
And it's brought us here because
You are the music in me
Together, we're gonna sing, yeah
We got the power to say what we feel (What we feel)
Connected and real
Can't keep it all inside, oh (Oh, yeah)
Na-na-na-na
Oh, yeah (Oh)
Na-na-na-na
Oh, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Na-na-na-na
You are the music in me
Na-na-na-na
Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah, yeah)
Na-na-na-na
Oh, yeah
Na-na-na-na
You are the music in me
When I hear my favorite song (Favorite song)
I know that we belong (We belong)
Oh, you are the music in me

It's brought us here because (Here because)
You are the music in me

Na-na-na-na
You are the music in me
