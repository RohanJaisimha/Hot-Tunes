Hey, oh!
Play ball!
Oh, oh, hey
Hey, hey, woo!
(sung)
Hey, batter, batter, hey batter, batter swing
I got to just do my thing
Hey, batter, batter, hey batter, batter swing
Yeah
I'll show you that it's one and the same
Baseball, dancin', same game
It's easy
Step up to the plate
Start swingin'
I wanna play ball now, and that's all
This is what I do
It ain't no dance that you can show me
(Hey, hey, hey) Yeah
You'll never know
Oh, I know
If you never try
There's just one little thing
That stops me every time, yeah
Come on!
I don't dance
I know you can
Not a chance, no
If I can do this, well
You can do that
But I don't dance
Hit it outta the park!
I don't dance
I say you can
There's not a chance, oh
Slide home, you score
Swingin' on the dance floor
I don't dance, no
Hey, batter, batter, hey batter, batter swing
I got to just do my thing
Hey, batter, batter, hey batter, batter swing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Two-steppin', now you're up to bat
Bases loaded, do your dance
It's easy
Take your best shot
Just hit it!
I've got what it takes playin' my game
So you better spin that pitch you're gonna throw me, yeah
I'll show you how I swing
You'll never know
Oh, I know
If you never try
There's just one little thing
That stops me every time
Yeah
Come on!
I don't dance
I know you can
Not a chance, no, no
If I can do this, well
You can do that
But I don't dance
Hit it outta the park!
I don't dance
I say you can
There's not a chance, oh, no
Slide home, you score
Swingin' on the dance floor
I don't dance, no
Lean back, tuck it in, take a chance
Swing it out, spin around, do the dance
I wanna play ball, not dancehall
I'm makin' a triple, not a curtain call
I can prove it to you 'til you know it's true
'Cause I can swing it, I can bring it to the diamond too
You're talkin' a lot
Show me what you got
Stop, swing!
Hey!
C'mon, swing it like this (Yeah)
(Drr) Oh
Swing! (C'mon)
Jitterbug, brrr (Just like that) da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da
That's what I mean
That's how you swing
You make a good pitch, but I don't believe
I say you can
I know I can't
I don't dance
You can do it
I don't dance, no
Nothin' to it
Atta boy, atta boy, yeah
Hey, batter, batter, hey, batter, batter, what?
One, two, three, four, everybody swing
Come on!
I don't dance
I know you can
Not a chance, no, no
If I can do this, well
You can do that
But I don't dance
Hit it outta the park!
I don't dance
I say you can
There's not a chance, oh
Slide home, you score
Swingin' on the dance floor
I don't dance, no
