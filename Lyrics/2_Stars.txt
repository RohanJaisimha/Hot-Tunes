Wake up, when will things be good enough
For you to see all that we can be?
I'm sick of playin' games and actin' like
We never care, that we're never there
We pay attention (We pay attention)
For only seconds (For only seconds)
Look at you, look at me
There's never any us
Can't you see all we can become?
We can shine like the sun
If we believe that two stars are brighter than one
Come on, come on, come on, look at you
Come on, come on, come on, look at me
Listen (Listen), the way we feel is not just about you or me
It's the harmony
Just give in (Give in)
'Cause together, we'll be brighter than just any star
A work of art
We'll make the sky bright (Make the sky)
We'll light it, you and I
Look at you, look at me
There's never any us
Can't you see all we can become?
We can shine like the sun
If we believe that two stars are brighter than one
Come on, come on, come on, look at you
Come on, come on, come on
Is it too much ask that you put us first? Oh
I feel like we're last in our universe
And that's not where we ought to be
Look at you, look at me
There's never any us
Can't you see all we can become?
We can shine like the sun
If we believe that two stars are brighter than one
Look at you, look at me
There's never any us
Can't you see all we can become?
We can shine like the sun
If we believe that two stars are brighter than one
Come on, come on, come on, look at you
Come on, come on, come on, look at me
Come on, come on, come on, look at you
Come on, come on, come on, look at me
