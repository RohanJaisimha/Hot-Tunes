Coach said to fake right and break left
Watch out for the pick and keep an eye on defense
Gotta run the give-and-go, take the ball to the hole
And don't be afraid to shoot the outside J
Uh, just keep ya head in the game
Uh, just keep ya head in the game
And don't be afraid to shoot the outside J
Uh, just keep ya head in the game
You gotta get'cha, get'cha head in the game
We gotta get our, get our, get our, get our head in the game
You gotta get'cha, get'cha head in the game
We gotta get our, get our, get our, get our head in the game
C'mon, get'cha, get'cha head in the game
We gotta get our, get our, get our, get our head in the game
You gotta get'cha (Get our), get'cha (Get our) head in the game
We gotta get our, get our, get our, get our head in the game
Woo!
Let's make sure that we get the rebound
'Cause when we get it then the crowd will go wild
A second chance, gotta grab it and go
Maybe this time, we'll hit the right notes
Wait a minute, not the time and place
Wait a minute, get my head in the game
Wait a minute, get my head in the game
Wait a minute, wait a minute (Get'cha head in the game)
I gotta get my, get my head in the game
You gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game
I gotta get my, get my head in the game
We gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game
C'mon, get my, get my head in the game
You gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game
I gotta get my (Get'cha), get my (Get'cha) head in the game
You gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game
Woo!
Why am I feeling so wrong?
My head's in the game, but my heart's in the song
She makes this feel so right
(spoken)
Should I go for it?
I better shake this
Yikes
I gotta get my, get my head in the game
You gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game
I gotta get my, get my head in the game
We gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game
C'mon, get my, get my head in the game
You gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game

You gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game
