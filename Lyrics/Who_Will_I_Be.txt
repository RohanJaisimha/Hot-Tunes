Whoa
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
How to choose who to be?
Well, let's see, there's so many choices now
Play guitar, be a movie star
In my head, a voice says
"Why not try everything?"
"Why stop? Reach for any dream"
I can rock
'Cause it's my life and now's the time
Who will I be? It's up to me
All the never-ending possibilities that I can see
There's nothing that I can't do
Who will I be? Yes, I believe
I get to make the future what I want to
If I can become anyone and know the choice is up to me
Who will I be?
Yeah, yeah
If I decide I'm the girl
To change the world
I can do it anytime
Opportunity right in front of me
And the choice is all mine
Why not try everything?
Why stop? Reach for any dream
I can rock
'Cause it's my life and now's the time
Who will I be? It's up to me
All the never-ending possibilities that I can see
There's nothing that I can't do
Who will I be? Yes, I believe
I get to make the future what I want to
If I can become anyone and know the choice is up to me
Who will I be? I wanna find out who I am inside
Who will I be? I wanna show the
The way that I can shine, yeah! (Who will I be?)
Oh, yeah, yeah
Who will I be? It's up to me
All the never-ending possibilities that I can see
There's nothing that I can't do
Who will I be? (Yeah) Yes, I believe
