We're soarin', flyin'
There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach
If we're trying
So we're breaking free
You know the world can see us
In a way that's different than who we are
Creating space between us
'Til we're separate hearts
But your faith, it gives me strength
Strength to believe
We're breaking free
We're soarin'
Flyin'
There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach
If we're tryin'
Yeah, we're breaking free
Oh, we're breaking free
Ooh
Can you feel it building?
Like a wave the ocean just can't control
Connected by a feeling
Ooh, in our very souls
Very souls, oh
Rising 'til it lifts us up
So everyone can see
We're breaking free
We're soarin'
Flyin'
There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach
If we're tryin'
Yeah, we're breaking free
Oh, we're breaking free
Ooh
Runnin'
Climbin'
To get to that place to be all that we can be
Now's the time
So we're breaking free, we're breaking free
Ooh, yeah
More than hope, more than faith
This is truth, this is fate
And together we see it coming
More than you, more than me
Not a want, but a need
Both of us, breaking free
Soarin'
Flyin'
There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach
If we're tryin'
Yeah, we're breaking free
Breaking free
We're runnin'
Ooh, climbin'
To get to that place to be all that we can be
Now's the time
Now's the time
So we're breaking free
Oh, we're breaking free
Oh
You know the world can see us
In a way thatâ€™s different than who we are
