Who's got what it takes to be my guy?
What it takes to make me shine?
What it takes to get me fired up?
Who's got what it takes to be my beau?
What it takes to make me glow?
What it takes to make this beat flow?
Everyone talks about what they think they need
They're makin' up a list of things, one, two, three
Everyone is different, but where we can agree
Every girl wants her boy to treat her sweet
Don't think that bein' mean will get you anywhere
Don't think that actin' cool will make me wanna care
I need your respect if you're gonna be the one
And if you must apply, then try to get the job done
Who's got what it takes to be my guy?
What it takes to make me shine?
What it takes to get me fired up?
Who's got what it takes to be my beau?
What it takes to make me glow?

Talk can be so cheap, so I just look for action
Be good to me if you want my attraction
Maybe I just want too much, but I don't really care
I know I'm worth it and I know he's out there
Wait, wait, you might be a contender
Hey, hey, can I borrow your sweatshirt?
Normally I'm not the one to say hello first
But if I didn't, I might miss out and that might hurt
Who's got what it takes to be my guy?
What it takes to make me shine?
What it takes to get me fired up?
Who's got what it takes to be my beau?
What it takes to make me glow?
What it takes to make this beat flow?
I've been contemplating what
It takes to make me give my heart
Could you be the one?
Standing in the crowd
I'm waiting to find out
I'm waiting, waiting, waiting, oh
Who's got what it takes to be my guy?
What it takes to make me shine?
What it takes to get me fired up?
