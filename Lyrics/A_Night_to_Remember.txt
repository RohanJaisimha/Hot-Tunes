Guess now it's official
Can't back out, can't back out
No!
Gettin' ready (Ready) (Huh?)
For the night of nights (Uh-huh)
The night of nights, alright
Don't panic
Panic!
Now do we have to dress up for the prom?
Dude, I don't think we have the choice (Uh)
Yeah, it's the night of all nights, gotta look just right (Yeah)
Dressin' to impress the boys
Do I want classic or vintage or plaid?
Where's the mirror?
I think this tux is too baggy
Too tight, it makes me look weird
Should I go movie star glamorous?
Sassy or sweet?
Don't know, but no one better wear the same dress as me!
It's the night of our nightmares
It's the night of our dreams
It's too late to back out of it
Hey! Makeovers, massages
Don't know what a corsage is
Been waitin' all our lives for this
It's gonna be a night
Can't wait
To remember
Aw, man
Come on, now
Big fun, alright!
It's gonna be the night
I guess
To last forever
Lucky us
We'll never, ever, ever forget
Gettin' ready
Get ready
Get, a-gettin' ready, ready
Get ready
Gettin' ready (Here we go)
Get, a-gettin' ready, go!
Hey, you've been in there an hour, man!
So, what should I do with my hair?
Where's my shaver?
Ooh, I love it
I look like a waiter!
Should I fluff it?
It's getting late, I already should be there
Her mother opens the door
I'm shakin' inside (Yeah)
He's here, it's time
The hour's arrived
Don't know why her father's starin' me down
Where's my purse, lip gloss?
Now I'm really freakin' out
Then something changes my world
The most beautiful girl
Right in front of my eyes
It's gonna be a night
Oh, yeah
To remember
That's for sure
Come on, now
Big fun, alright!
It's gonna be the night
Here, tonight
To last forever
Forevermore
We'll never, ever, ever forget
Who's that girl?
(sung)
She's so fine
Who's that guy?
(sung)
I don't recognize (Oh)
Who's that girl?
(sung)
She looks so good, yeah
Guess you never really noticed, but you probably should
(spoken)
Big fun!
On the night of nights
Alright!
The night of nights, tonight
Let's dance!
On the night of nights
You know we're gonna do it right
It's gonna be a night
To remember
It's gonna be the night
To last forever
It's gonna be our night (Yeah)
To remember
It's gonna be the night
To last forever (Last forever)
It's gonna be our night
You know it
To remember
For all time
Come on now, big fun (To remember)
It's gonna be the night
We love it
To last forever
The rest of our lives
We'll never, ever, ever forget
It's gonna be our night
Oh, yeah
All together
Say it loud
Come on, now
Everyone, that's right!
It's gonna be a night
Here, tonight
To remember
Hear the crowd
And never, ever, ever, never
Ever, ever, never, ever
Never, ever, ever forget!
