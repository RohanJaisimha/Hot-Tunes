The day a door is closed
The echoes fill your soul
They won't say which way to go
Just trust your heart
To find what you're here for
Open another door
But I'm not sure anymore
It's just so hard
Voices in my head tell me they know best
Got me on the edge
They're pushin', pushin', they're pushin'
I know they've got a plan, but the ball's in my hands
This time, it's man to man
I'm drivin', fightin' inside a world that's upside down
And spinnin' faster
What do I do now, without you?
I don't know where to go
What's the right team?
I want my own thing
So bad I'm gonna scream
I can't choose, so confused
What's it all mean?
I want my own dream
So bad I'm gonna scream
I'm kickin' down the walls, I gotta make 'em fall
Just break through 'em all
I'm punchin', crashin', I'm gonna
Fight to find myself, me and no one else
Which way? I can't tell
I'm searchin', searchin'
Can't find the way that I should turn
I should turn, right or left?
It's, it's like nothing works without you
I don't know where to go
What's the right team?
I want my own thing
So bad I'm gonna scream
I can't choose, so confused
What's it all mean?
I want my own dream
So bad I'm gonna scream
Yeah, the clock's running down
Hear the crowd gettin' loud
I'm consumed by the sound
(spoken)
Is it her? Is it love?
Can the music ever be enough?
Gotta work it out, gotta work it out
You can do it, you can do it!
(sung)
I don't know where to go
What's the right team?
I want my own thing
So bad I'm gonna scream
I can't choose, so confused
What's it all mean?
I want my own dream
So bad I'm gonna scream
I don't know where to go
What's the right team?
I want my own thing
I want my own thing
I can't choose, so confused
What's it all mean?
I want my own dream
So bad I'm gonna scream
Oh
(spoken)
Ahh!
