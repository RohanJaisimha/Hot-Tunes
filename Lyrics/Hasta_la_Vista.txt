Yeah, it's ya boy, Barry
Yo
And the place to be
It's crazy
Come rock with me (Woo!)
Ha, couldn't wait to leave, but now I hate to go
Last day of camp, packin' my bags slow (Slow)
Made so many friends, why does it have to end?
In the end, it's a win
'Cause we grown so close together
Remember when we first met, first day? (Day)
Thinkin' this would be no fun, no way (Way)
Now it's time to leave (Leave)
But now we wanna stay (Stay)
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, oh!
Hasta la vista
I'ma gonna say goodbye to you (Yeah)
Whatever happens, I'll be cool with you
Wanna give me your number?
I'ma call ya, promise I won't forget ya
Hasta la vista
We'll all be going separate ways
Say everything you didn't say
This is your moment, before you go
Come on now, get up and show them
Keep doin' your thing, thing, thing
Keep doin' your thing, thing, thing
And I'ma do my thing
There's so much more inside of me
There's so much more (More) I just wanna be
All the things I've seen, obviously I'm inspired
Got love for all the friendships I've acquired (Hey, hey)
Everybody put a hand up, put a hand up (Oh)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Everybody put a hand up, put a hand up (Go crazy)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hasta la vista
I'ma gonna say goodbye to you
Whatever happens, I'll be cool with you (Oh)
Wanna give me your number?
I'ma call ya, promise I won't forget ya
Hasta la vista
We'll all be going separate ways (Don't stop)
Say everything you didn't say
This is your moment, before you go
Come on now, get up and show them
Keep doin' your thing, thing, thing
Keep doin' your thing, thing, thing
Keep doin' your thing, thing, thing (Yo, yo, yo)
Keep doin' your thing, thing, thing (Yo, y-y-yo, yo)
