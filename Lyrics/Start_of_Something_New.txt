Livin' in my own world
Didn't understand
That anything can happen
When you take a chance
I never believed in
What I couldn't see
I never opened my heart, oh
To all the possibilities, ooh
I know
That something has changed
Never felt this way
And right here tonight
This could be the start of something new
It feels so right
To be here with you, oh
And now, lookin' in your eyes
I feel in my heart (Feel in my heart)
The start of something new
Oh, yeah
Now who'd have ever thought that, mmm
We'd both be here tonight?
Oh, yeah
And the world looks so much brighter (Brighter, brighter)
Oh, with you by my side (By my side)
I know that something has changed
Never felt this way
I know it for real
This could be the start of something new
It feels so right to be here with you, oh
And now, lookin' in your eyes
I feel in my heart
The start of something new
I never knew that it could happen
'Til it happened to me
Oh, yeah
I didn't know it before
But now it's easy to see, oh
It's the start of something new
It feels so right to be here with you, oh
And now, lookin' in your eyes
I feel in my heart
That it's the start of something new
It feels so right (So right) to be here with you, oh
And now, lookin' in your eyes (Lookin' in your eyes)
I feel in my heart (Feel in my heart)
The start of something new
The start of something new
The start of something new
