Ooh, ooh
Together, together
Together everyone
Together, together
Come on, let's have some fun
Here and now, it's time for celebration
We finally figured out, yeah, yeah
That all our dreams have no limitations
That's what it's all about
Everyone is special in their own way
We make each other strong (We make each other strong)
We're not the same
We're different in a good way
Together's where we belong
We're all in this together
Once we know that we are, we're all stars
And we see that
We're all in this together
And it shows when we stand hand in hand
Make our dreams come true
(Make our dreams come true)
Together, together
Together everyone
Together, together
Come on, let's have some fun
Together, we're there for
Each other every time
Together, together
Come on, let's do this right
We're all here
And speakin' out with one voice
We're gonna rock the house (Yeah)
The party's on
Now everybody make some noise
Come on, scream and shout
We've arrived
Because we stuck together
Champions one and all
We're all in this together
Once we know that we are, we're all stars
And we see that
We're all in this together
And it shows when we stand hand in hand
Make our dreams come true
All in this together
Together
We're all in this together (All in this together)
Once we know that we are, we're all stars
And we see that
We're all in this together (All in this together)
And it shows when we stand hand in hand
Make our dreams comeâ€”
We're all in this together (All in this together)
When we reach, we can fly, know inside
We can make it
We're all in this together (All in this together)
Once we see there's a chance that we have
And we take it
We're all in this together (All in this together)
Oh, all in this together
