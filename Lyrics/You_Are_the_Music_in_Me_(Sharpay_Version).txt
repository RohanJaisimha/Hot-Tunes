Five, six, seven, eight!
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na
You are the music in—
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na
You are the music in—
Are the music in—
You know the words "Once upon a time"
Makes you listen
There's a reason
And when you dream, there's a chance you'll find
A little laughter
Or happy ever after
You're harmony to the melody
That's echoing inside my head (My head)
A single voice
Above the noise
Like a common thread
Sing it to me
When I hear my favorite song
I know we belong
'Cause you are the music in me
It's livin' in all of us
It's here because, you are!
The music in me
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na
You are the music in—
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na
You are the music in—
Are the music in—
Harmony to melody
Echoin' inside my head
Ooh, ah
When I hear my favorite song
I know we belong
'Cause you are the music in me
It's livin' in all of us
It's here because, you are!
The music in
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Na-na-na
You are the music in—
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na
You are the music in
Me, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
