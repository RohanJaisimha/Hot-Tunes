You never know what you're gonna feel, oh
You never see it comin', suddenly it's real
Oh
Never even crossed my mind, no
That I would ever end up here tonight
Oh, all things change
When you don't expect them to, yeah, oh
No one knows what the future's gonna do
I never even noticed that you've been there all along
I can't take my eyes off of you, oh
I know you feel the same way too, yeah
I can't take my eyes off of you
All it took was one look
For a dream come true
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh
Yeah, we got a good thing goin' on
Oh
Right here is right where we belong
You never really know what you might find
Now all I see is you and I
You're everything I never knew that I've been lookin' for
I can't take my eyes off of you
I know you feel the same way too, yeah
I can't take my eyes off of you
All it took was one look
For a dream come true
Can't take my eyes off of you
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
So let the music play
Can't take my eyes off of you, whoa
Yeah, the feeling's getting stronger
And I never ever felt this way
Alright, I see everything
In your eyes, oh, oh, whoa, oh
Alright, something's happening
'Cause everyone's around
But you're the only one I see
I can't take my eyes off of you, oh-whoa
I know you feel the same way too, yeah
I can't take my eyes off of you
All it took was one look
For a dream come true
I can't take my eyes off of you, whoa, oh
Feelings like I never knew (I never knew, never knew, oh)
I can't take my eyes off of you (I can't take my eyes)
From the start, got my heart
Yeah, you do
Can't take my eyes off of you
