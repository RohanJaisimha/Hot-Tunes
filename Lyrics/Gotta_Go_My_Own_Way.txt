Troy...
Listen
(sung)
I gotta say what's on my mind
Somethin' about us doesn't seem right these days
Life keeps getting in the way
Whenever we try, somehow, the plan
Is always rearranged
It's so hard to say
But I gotta do what's best for me
You'll be okay
I've got to move on and be who I am
I just don't belong here, I hope you understand
We might find a place in this world someday
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way
(My own way)
Don't wanna leave it all behind
But I get my hopes up and I watch them fall every time
Another color turns to gray
And it's just too hard to watch it all
Slowly fade away
I'm leavin' today
'Cause I gotta do what's best for me
You'll be okay
I've got to move on and be who I am
I just don't belong here, I hope you understand
We might find our place in this world someday
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way
What about us?
What about everythin' we've been through?
What about trust?
You know I never wanted to hurt you
What about me?
What am I supposed to do?
I gotta leave but I'll miss you
Oh
So, I've got to move on and be who I am
Why do you have to go?
I just don't belong here, I hope you understand
I'm trying to understand
We might find a place in this world someday
But at least for now
I want you to stay
I gotta go my own way
I've got to move on and be who I am
What about us?
I just don't belong here, I hope you understand
I'm trying to understand
We might find our place in this world someday (World someday)
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way
I gotta go my own way
I gotta go my own way
