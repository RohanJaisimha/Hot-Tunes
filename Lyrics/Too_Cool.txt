I'm too cool for my dress
These shades don't leave my head
Everything you say is so irrelevant
You follow and I lead
You wanna be like me
But you're just a wannabe, love it or hate it
(Ah) I can't help the way I am (Ah)
Hope you don't misunderstand (Ha, ha, ha)
But I'm too cool, too cool
Yeah, I'm too cool to know you
Don't take it personal, don't get emotional
You know it's the truth
I'm too cool for you
You think you're hot, but I'm sorry, you're not
Exactly who you think you are
Can't tell you what you haven't got
But when we walk into the room
I'm too cool for you
You're lucky I'm so nice
Even I'm surprised
You are still allowed to be in my crew
Show you how it's done
If you wanna be someone
Just watch me and you'll learn some
(Ah) Me, myself, and I agree (Ah)
You'll never catch up with me (Ha, ha, ha)
'Cause I'm too cool, too cool
Yeah, I'm too cool to know you
Don't take it personal, don't get emotional
You know it's the truth
I'm too cool for you
You think you're hot, but I'm sorry, you're not
Exactly who you think you are
Can't tell you what you haven't got
But when we walk into the room
I'm too cool for you
You see, some are born with beauty, brains, and talent
And they've got it all (Ooh)
While others have to try all their lives
Still they never get the call
That's the difference between you and me, obviously
I'm a natural, I'm the real deal, no
I can't help the way I am (Ah)
Hope you don't misunderstand (Ha, ha, ha)
But I'm too cool, too cool
Yeah, I'm too cool to know you
Don't take it personal, don't get emotional
You know it's the truth
I'm too cool for you
Too cool, too cool
Yeah, I'm too cool to know you
Don't take it personal, don't get emotional
You know it's the truth
I'm too cool for you
