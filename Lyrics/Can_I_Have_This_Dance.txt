Take my hand, take a breath
Pull me close and take one step
Keep your eyes locked on mine
And let the music be your guide
Won't you promise me?
Now won't you promise me
That you'll never forget?
We'll keep dancing...
To keep dancing...
Wherever we go next
It's like catching lightning
The chances of finding someone like you
It's one in a million
The chances of feelin' the way we do
And with every step together
We just keep on gettin' better
So can I have this dance?
Can I have this dance?
Can I have this dance?
Take my hand, I'll take the lead
And every turn will be safe with me
Don't be afraid, afraid to fall
You know I'll catch you through it all
And you can't keep us apart
Even a thousand miles can't keep us apart
'Cause my heart is...
'Cause my heart is...
Wherever you are
It's like catching lightning
The chances of finding someone like you
It's one in a million
The chances of feelin' the way we do
And with every step together
We just keep on gettin' better
So can I have this dance?
Can I have this dance?
Can I have this dance?
Oh, no mountain's too high and no ocean's too wide
'Cause together or not, our dance won't stop
Let it rain
Let it pour
What we have is worth fighting for
You know I believe that we were meant to be, yeah
It's like catching lightning
The chances of finding someone like you (Like you)
It's one in a million
The chances of feelin' the way we do (Way we do)
And with every step together
We just keep on gettin' better
So can I have this dance?
Can I have this dance?
Can I have this dance?
Can I have this dance?
Can I have this dance?
