Coach said to fake right, break left
Watch out for the pick and keep your eye on the defense
You gotta run the give-and-go, take the ball to the hole
Like an old school pro
He said "Don't be afraid, whatcha waitin' on?"
"Shoot the outside J"
I gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game
I gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game (Whoa)
Gotta get'cha, get'cha head in the game (Whoa)
Gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game (Whoa)
Gotta get'cha, get'cha head in the game (Whoa)
Gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game (Whoa)
Gotta get'cha, get'cha head in the game
Gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game (Whoa)
Gotta get'cha, get'cha head in the game
Gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game (Whoa)
Let's make sure that we get the rebound (Rebound)
'Cause when we get it, then the crowd will go wild (Go wild)
A second chance, gotta grab it and go
And maybe this time we'll hit the right note
Wait a minute, put ya head in the game (Oh)
Wait a minute, put ya head in the game (Oh)
Wait a minute, put ya head in the game (Oh!)
Gotta get'cha, get'cha head in the game (Whoa)
Gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game (Whoa)
Gotta get'cha, get'cha head in the game (Whoa)
Gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game (Whoa)

Gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game (Whoa)
Gotta get'cha, get'cha head in the game
Gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game
Why am I feelin' so wrong?
My head is in the game, but my heart's in the song
She makes me feel so right
Should I go for this? You better shake this
Should I take the ball down the middle? Then I shoot the shot
I move fast when I dribble, watch out for the block
I lose focus when I think of her name
I gotta get, get my head in the game
Does she think about me? Does she feel the same way?
Should I shoot for a three? Gotta stay in gameplay
I think I'm goin' insane
Can't get her out of my brain
Gotta get'cha, get'cha head in the game
Gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game
Gotta get'cha, get'cha head in the game (Whoa)
Gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game (Whoa)
Gotta get'cha, get'cha head in the game (Whoa)
