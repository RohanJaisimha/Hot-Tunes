They tell you a good girl is quiet
And that you should never ask why
'Cause it only makes it harder to fit in
And you should be happy, excited
Even if you're just invited
'Cause the winners need someone to clap for them
It's so hard just waitin'
In a line that never moves
It's time you started makin' your own rules
You gotta scream until there's nothing left
With your last breath
Say, "Here I am, here I am"
Make 'em listen
'Cause there's no way you'll be ignored
Not anymore
Say, "Here I am, here I am"
Here I am, oh-oh-oh
Here I am, oh-oh
You only get one life to work it
So who cares if it's not perfect?
I say it's close enough to perfect for me
Why should you hide from the thunder
And the lightning that you're under?
'Cause there ain't nobody else you wanna be
If how you're livin' isn't workin'
There's one thing that will help
You gotta finally just stop searchin' to find yourself, oh
You gotta scream until there's nothing left
With your last breath
Say, "Here I am, here I am"
Make 'em listen
'Cause there's no way you'll be ignored
Not anymore
Say, "Here I am, here I am"
Here I am
The world better make some room
Yeah, move over, over
'Cause you're comin' through
'Cause you're comin' through
You gotta scream until there's nothing left
With your last breath
Here I am, here I am
Make 'em listen
'Cause there's no way you'll be ignored
Not anymore
Say, "Here I am, here I am"
Here I am, oh-oh-oh
Here I am, oh-oh-oh
Here I am
