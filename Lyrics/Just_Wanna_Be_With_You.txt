Mmm, mmm, yeah
I got a lot of things I have to do
All these distractions, our future's comin' soon
We're being pulled
A hundred different directions
But whatever happens
I know I've got you
You're on my mind, you're in my heart
It doesn't matter where we are
We'll be alright, even if we're miles apart
All I wanna do
Is be with you, be with you
There's nothing we can't do
Just wanna be with you, only you
No matter where life takes us
Nothing can break us apart (You know it's true)
I just wanna be with you
Yeah, yeah
Just be with you
Ooh, yeah
You know how life can be
It changes overnight
It's sunny then rainin'
But it's alright
A friend like you
Always makes it easy
I know that you get me
Every time
Through every up, through every down
You know I'll always be around
Through anything, you can count on me
All I wanna do
Is be with you, be with you
There's nothing we can't do
Just wanna be with you, only you
No matter where life takes us
Nothing can break us apart (You know it's true)
I just wanna be with you
I just wanna be with you
